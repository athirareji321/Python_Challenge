## Activity 1 - Py Bank

## Overview 

### A Python script which analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:
-	### The total number of months included in the dataset
-	### The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-	### The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  
### The resource dataset (budget_data) is a csv file and is composed of three columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

### The script also prints the result to the terminal as well as an external text file (pybank_budget_data) to a folder named ‘pybankanalysis’ with the above analysis data.

#### The expected results is as follows:
